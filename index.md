I am a research scientist at [Nuro], working to apply reinforcement learning in the exciting domain of autonomous vehicles.

Prior to this, I was a PhD student at Brown University, advised by [George Konidaris]. I primarily worked on developing better exploration methods for deep reinforcement learning, that helped agents learn without needing a dense supervisory signal. During Summer 2024 I interned with [Sony AI], where I developed exploration algorithms for reinforcement learning agents in Playstation video games.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015, where I studied Physics, Math, and a little bit of Computer Science. Between then and graduate school I held a variety of jobs as a programmer (some odd, some real). During this time I also geared up for my Ph.D, most notably by doing research in the [Lawrence Carin's] inviting research group at Duke.
