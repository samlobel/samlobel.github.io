I am a Computer Science PhD student advised by [George Konidaris], in the [Intelligent Robot Lab] at [Brown University]. Generally, I am interested in understanding the implicit assumptions which make the real world's infinite possibilities manageable to learners such as ourselves.


I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015, where I studied Physics, Math, and a very little bit of Computer Science. Between then and graduate school I held a variety of jobs as a programmer while also gearing up for my current post.
