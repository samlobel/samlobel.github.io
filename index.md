I am a Computer Science PhD candidate working on reinforcement learning, and am advised by [George Konidaris] in the [Intelligent Robot Lab] at [Brown University]. My research is funded in part by the NSF [Graduate Research Fellowship Program].

At Brown, I primarily work on developing exploration methods that better direct agents towards experiences from which they can learn the most. I also work on improving aspects of RL optimization that differ from standard supervised learning, such as bootstrapping and action selection. During Summer 2024 I interned with [Sony AI], where I developed exploration algorithms for reinforcement learning agents in Playstation video games.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015, where I studied Physics, Math, and a little bit of Computer Science. Between then and graduate school I held a variety of jobs as a programmer while also gearing up for my current post.
